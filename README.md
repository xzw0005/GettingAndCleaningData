# GettingAndCleaningData

The input dataset is the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset which could be downloaded from <https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip>. 

Our goal of this project is to collect, work with, and clean the data set. 

The repository includes the following files:

* "READEME.md"
* "CodeBook.md": describes the variables, the data, and transformations or work performed to clean up the data.
* "runAnalysis.R": R code that ran for this project to clean the data
* "tidyData.txt":  the output, a plain-text file with tab-separated values (average of each variable for each activity and each subject).
